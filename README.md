# Projection-and-its-algorithm
In this program, we will encounter an algorithm to take the projection of any 3D polyhedron onto a plane passing through a specific point inside it. We will be engaged with linear algebra, linear space transformation, 3D geometry involving equation of planes and lines, vector algebra, inverse trigonometry and 3D spherical coordinate system.
